# Smart-Book-Tracking-System

The college library is implementing a new "Smart Book Tracking System". Throughout the day, books are returned by students at random times, and each returned book has a unique Book ID (a positive integer).
The librarian wants a system that can:
Store each Book ID immediately when a book is returned
Quickly check whether a particular Book ID has been returned or not
At closing time, display all returned Book IDs in ascending (sorted) order, without using any sorting algorithm such as bubble sort, merge sort, or inbuilt sort functions


It is a menu-driven C++ program that implements the above features
